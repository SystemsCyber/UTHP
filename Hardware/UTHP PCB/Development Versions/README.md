# Development Versions
This directory holds some artifacts from previous iterations of the PCB. These were produced in small quantity for testing. They are included here only for archival purposes and should not be used for any realistic deployment.

#### Version 1 Errata:
1. The LEDs needs to be moved towards the center of the board to keep the LEDs from interering with the light pipes.
2. The DSUB15 connector needs to be moved towards the edge of the board.
3. There are many other changes that make version 1 of the board unsuitable for use.
