# Graphics for the bottom of the UTHP
The bottom graphics on the UTHP are intended to help the user recall common pinout definitions and serialize the enclosure for easier tracking. 

The files in this directory include QR codes that encode the serial number. It also includes a python script that generates the graphics and LaTeX code that renders the pdf.

To run the python code, be sure to install the qr code library.

```pip install qrcode[pil]```
