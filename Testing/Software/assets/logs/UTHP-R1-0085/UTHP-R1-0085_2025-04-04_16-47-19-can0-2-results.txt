Please ensure you are running this script on the post-production UTHP hardware (eMMC).
Also ensure the J1939 bus is powered.
Are you connected to a 12v CAN bus on the deutch 9 pin? (y/n)y
Setting up the environment for testing the can0-2 uthp tests...
=====================================================
Unique identifiers for UTHP-R1-0085:
mmcblk1      
|-mmcblk1p1  9007-6910
`-mmcblk1p2  ccb2a4d1-da0f-436d-afc4-5d4c91ebbcda
mmcblk1boot0 
mmcblk1boot1 
Enter the desired CAN bus baud rate (e.g., 500000): 250000
Setting up the CAN interface...
Environment setup should be complete... waiting for user to confirm hardware is ready.
Press any key to continue...
Starting the can0-2 uthp tests...
